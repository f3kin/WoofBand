# The 'Woof Band'
App Website - Coming Soon
### What is it?
- I'm developing a 'smart' dog collar that I hope will improve how we care for our pets by bridging the communication gap between humans and dogs. 

- AI allows us to map a dog's actions to its biometrics (like heart rate, skin temperature, and barking), so we can predict what a dog will do or even what it 'wants' to do based on sensor readings of its biometric data. 

- For example, when a dog needs to use the bathroom, its skin temperature rises, its heart rate elevates, and it may begin to whine, allowing us to notify the owner so they can let their pet outside. 

### The interface
- To facilitate the communication between pet and owner, I plan to use a similar UX to the best-selling 'Tamagotchi' toy, so that the communication is 
delivered in a user-friendly, casual manner. 

- This will involve custom animal emojis and home screen interfaces for Apple devices.
